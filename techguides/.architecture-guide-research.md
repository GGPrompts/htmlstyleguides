# Software Architecture Guide — Research Data (Feb 2026)

## 1. Architecture Patterns & Trends

### Modular Monolith Renaissance
- **Shopify**: 2.8M-line Ruby modular monolith, 32M req/min, 30TB/min data, uses Packwerk for boundaries
- **Amazon Prime Video**: Consolidated microservices to monolith, 90% infrastructure cost reduction
- **Twilio Segment**: Consolidated 140+ microservices into single monolith
- **37signals/DHH**: Full cloud exit by 2025, saving ~$2M/year, 99.99% uptime on owned hardware
- **CNCF 2025 survey**: 42% of orgs that adopted microservices have consolidated back
- **Cost**: Microservices 3.75-6x more expensive ($40-65K/month vs ~$15K/month enterprise scale)
- **Service mesh adoption declined**: 18% (Q3 2023) → 8% (Q3 2025)
- **Gartner**: 90% of orgs would fail with microservices through 2025 (premature adoption)

### Frameworks for Modular Monoliths
| Framework | Ecosystem | Key Features |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Spring Modulith 2.0 | Java/Spring | Compile-time boundaries, module-aware tracing, event-driven inter-module |
| .NET Aspire | .NET | Dashboard, service discovery, health monitoring, orchestration |
| Packwerk | Ruby (Shopify) | Static analysis for boundary enforcement |
| Service Weaver | Go (Google) | Write monolith, deploy as monolith or distributed |

### Key Advocates
- Martin Fowler: "Monolith First"
- Sam Newman: Modular monolith often solves all problems
- DHH: "The Majestic Monolith"
- Chris Richardson: Architecture tied to org scalability, not tech trends

### Architecture Decision Framework
- **Solo (1 dev)**: Simple monolith, PaaS, SQLite/Postgres
- **Small Team (2-10)**: Modular monolith, single pipeline, hexagonal internals
- **Growth (10-50)**: Modular monolith + 2-5 extracted services, event bus, 2-3 platform engineers
- **Enterprise (100+)**: Microservices at 50+ engineers (necessary at 200+), Team Topologies, IDP, DORA metrics
- Chris Richardson "Success Triangle": process + organization + architecture

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Kafka: de facto standard, Slack uses for billions daily messages
- CQRS: 64% read performance improvement
- Spring Modulith 2.0: "Resilient Eventing Simplified" for modular monoliths
- Event-Carried State Transfer gaining in monolith contexts

### Hexagonal/Clean Architecture
- Gold standard for internal module structure
- AWS published prescriptive guidance recommending hexagonal
- Used as internal structure of modules, not system-level architecture
- DDD strategic patterns (bounded contexts) directly inform module boundaries

## 2. Frontend Landscape

### Meta-Framework Comparison
| Framework | Best For | Key News |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Next.js 16 | Enterprise React, largest ecosystem | Turbopack default, PPR, RSC (but community friction) |
| Nuxt 4 | Vue teams, clean DX | Vercel acquired NuxtLabs (July 2025), Nuxt UI Pro going free/OSS |
| SvelteKit | Performance-critical, highest dev satisfaction | Svelte 5 Runes, #1 DX in State of JS 2025, 2-3x faster start |
| Remix 3 | Web-standards-first | DROPPED React entirely for Preact fork — major shift |
| React Router 7 | SPA + framework modes | Absorbed Remix patterns, 3 modes (SPA, data, framework) |
| Astro 6 | Content sites (undisputed king) | Islands Architecture, Server Islands, Astro 6 beta early 2026 |

### HTMX
- Legitimate paradigm for 60-70% of apps that never needed SPA
- Best with: Django, Rails, FastAPI, Go templates, Phoenix
- NOT for: offline support, complex client state, Figma-like apps

### Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- "The debate is over" — this is the default
- Tailwind CSS 4: CSS-first config (no more tailwind.config.js)
- shadcn/ui ecosystem: 11+ specialized extension libraries (Motion Primitives, Origin UI 400+ components, Kibo UI)
- Copy-paste model prevents lock-in

### Stack Overflow 2025
- JavaScript: 66% usage (still #1)
- Python: +7 point increase (largest of any language)
- Docker: +17 point jump (largest single-year increase of any technology)
- FastAPI: +5 point increase
- Node.js + Express still lead backend frameworks

## 4. API Layer

### REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC vs tRPC
- **REST**: Default for public/B2B APIs. OpenAPI mature.
- **GraphQL**: Complex UIs, multiple client types. Adds complexity (N+1, caching).
- **gRPC**: Internal service-to-service. Protobuf, binary, high-throughput.
- **tRPC**: TypeScript monorepos only. 35-40% faster dev time. Zero code gen.
- **Hybrid is normal**: tRPC internal + REST public + GraphQL multi-client + gRPC distributed

### Schema-First vs Code-First
- Schema-first: Large orgs, public APIs, B2B (schema IS the product)
- Code-first: Small teams, rapid iteration, tRPC (FastAPI auto-generates OpenAPI)
