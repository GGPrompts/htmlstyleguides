# Meme Culture Platforms: History and Evolution Research Brief

## The "Meme" Concept

### Richard Dawkins and The Selfish Gene (1976)

**Definition and Origin:**
- Richard Dawkins coined the term "meme" in his 1976 book *The Selfish Gene*
- Etymology: Derived from Ancient Greek *mīmēma* (μίμημα), meaning "imitated thing"
- Shortened to "meme" to parallel "gene" and emphasize its role as a cultural replicator
- Definition: A unit of culture—such as "tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or building arches"

**The Gene/Meme Parallel:**
- Dawkins conceived of memes as the cultural parallel to biological genes
- Both genes and memes are replicators that generate copies of themselves
- Memes were presented as "selfish" units in control of their own reproduction
- The concept modeled human cultural evolution analogous to genetic evolution

### Evolution to Digital Context

**Mike Godwin's 1994 Wired Article:**
- Published in October 1994 issue of Wired magazine
- Article titled "Meme, counter-meme"
- Godwin explained how he "seeded" Godwin's Law as a counter to Nazi comparisons on Usenet
- Described how the Internet was especially conducive to spreading viral ideas
- One of the first uses of "meme" to refer to viral media and Internet communications
- The term "Internet meme" was coined by Mike Godwin in 1993 in reference to meme proliferation through early online communities (message boards, Usenet groups, email)
