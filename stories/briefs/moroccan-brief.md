# Moroccan Style Guide Research Brief

## Style: Moroccan
**Period:** Islamic Golden Age ~800–1400 AD (with modern connections)

**Story Concept:** An interactive journey through the mathematics hidden in Moroccan zellige tiles and Islamic geometric patterns, following a tile artisan in Fez learning from a master craftsman while uncovering how algebra, geometry, and spirituality converge in the art form. Parallel storylines connect ancient Islamic scholars (al-Khwarizmi), Moroccan tile masters, and modern mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani to show how geometric beauty has inspired minds across centuries.

## Key Historical Facts

1. **Al-Khwarizmi and Algebra's Birth (820s CE):** Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi completed *Al-Jabr* (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing) between 813–833 CE while working at the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, establishing algebra as a systematic mathematical field. His name became the root of the word "algorithm."

2. **House of Wisdom Establishment (786 CE):** The House of Wisdom was inaugurated during the reign of Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786–809 CE), becoming the intellectual center of the Islamic Golden Age and a hub for mathematical, astronomical, and geographical research.

3. **Islamic Golden Age Timeline (8th–13th centuries):** The Islamic Golden Age of mathematics and science extended from approximately the 8th century through the 13th century, with the period peaking during the 9th–10th centuries. The Mongol siege of Baghdad in 1258 marked the traditional end of this era.

4. **Al-Wafa and Trigonometry (900 CE):** By 900 CE, mathematician Abū al-Wafā' al-Būzjānī had described all three trigonometric functions, enabling advanced geometric calculations that directly influenced the mathematical precision of architectural designs like the Alhambra.

5. **Zellige Technique Origins (10th Century):** The technique of zellige tilework was born in Morocco in the 10th century, initially using only white and brown tones in imitation of Roman and Byzantine mosaics, later adapted by Muslim craftsmen for ceramic tiles.

6. **Zellige Flourishing Under Marinids (13th–14th centuries):** Zellige tile art flourished and became highly refined during the 13th and 14th centuries under Morocco's Marinid Dynasty, establishing the intricate geometric patterns that became synonymous with Moroccan design and spreading throughout the Islamic world.

7. **Fez University Foundation (859 CE):** The University of Al-Qarawiyyin was founded in Fez in 859 CE, making it the world's oldest continuously operating university and a major center of Islamic learning, including mathematics and geometry.

8. **Alhambra's Mathematical Wallpaper Groups (1238–1358):** The Alhambra in Granada, constructed between 1238–1358 during Nasrid rule, contains nearly all 17 mathematically possible wallpaper groups in its tile mosaics—a unique achievement demonstrating the Alhambra's architects' sophisticated geometric understanding.

9. **Muqarnas Composition (12th–14th centuries):** The Alhambra's muqarnas (honeycomb) vaulting composition consists of at least 5,000 precisely cut prismatic pieces that unfold from a central summit into sixteen miniature domes. This three-dimensional geometric achievement demonstrates the synthesis of mathematics and spirituality in Islamic architecture.

10. **Ibn Khaldun's Birth and Contributions (1332 CE):** Ibn Khaldun was born on 27 May 1332 in Tunis into an Andalusian family. A mathematician, historian, and philosopher, he pioneered modern methodology in historical analysis and became one of the greatest social scientists of the Middle Ages. He survived the Black Death in Tunis (1348–1349).

11. **Color Expansion in Zellige (14th–17th centuries):** The color palette of zellige tiles evolved dramatically: white and brown (10th century), blue and green added (14th century), yellow added (14th century), and red only becoming common in the 17th century. This expansion enabled increasingly complex and vibrant geometric compositions.

12. **Maryam Mirzakhani's Fields Medal (2014 CE):** On August 13, 2014, Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani became the first woman to win the Fields Medal, mathematics' highest honor. Her research in hyperbolic geometry and Riemann surfaces directly extended the geometric traditions established in Islamic mathematics over a thousand years earlier. She later died in 2017 at age 40.

## Dramatic Arc

**Setup:** A young apprentice arrives in Fez in the 14th century to learn zellige craftsmanship from an aging master. We see the medina's bustling souks, the University of Al-Qarawiyyin teaching geometry, and hear stories of the Alhambra's recent construction in Spain. The apprentice's family is dying from plague, and their only inheritance is the desire to create beauty through mathematical precision.

**Tension:** The master begins teaching not just how to cut and place tiles, but reveals that every pattern follows mathematical principles derived from algebra and geometry. The apprentice struggles to see how dusty equations relate to artistic vision. Meanwhile, we cut to al-Khwarizmi's Baghdad (820s) and see him discovering that geometry and algebra are unified languages describing creation itself. In the present timeline, a scholar brings news of the Alhambra's completion—proof that these geometric principles create spaces of transcendent beauty.

**Climax:** The apprentice understands: the patterns are not decorative flourishes but prayers in geometric form. They complete their first independent composition—a complex 8-pointed star surrounded by interlocking polygons—which perfectly embodies the mathematical relationships they've learned. The master confirms it's worthy. Cut to modern day: Maryam Mirzakhani, an Iranian mathematician, receives the Fields Medal for work on hyperbolic geometry, continuing the 1,200-year tradition of Islamic geometric discovery.

**Resolution:** The apprentice's tiles are installed in a riad courtyard. The master passes down the knowledge. We see time-lapse of zellige continuing to be made in Fez across centuries, each generation of artisans carrying forward the marriage of mathematics and beauty. The story ends with a quote: "Every tile is a proof that the universe is built on order, harmony, and infinite complexity"—attributed to both al-Khwarizmi and the nameless master craftsman.

## Summary for Story Implementation

This Moroccan style guide is uniquely suited for an immersive historical narrative because:

1. **Visual Hierarchy:** Gold text on deep blue creates dramatic contrast for key story moments
2. **Geometric Consistency:** All decorative elements use 8-pointed stars and Islamic patterns, reinforcing the mathematical theme
3. **Atmospheric Depth:** The zellige background pattern, star overlay, and frame decorations create an immersive "inside the medina" feeling
4. **Component Variety:** Diverse button, badge, card, and alert styles allow for multiple narrative functions within a cohesive aesthetic
5. **Color Symbolism:** Gold suggests enlightenment/knowledge, emerald suggests growth/life, terracotta grounds the story in physical craft
6. **Typography Flexibility:** Three fonts allow different "voices" (display for authority, Cormorant for narrative flow, Amiri for tradition/poetry)

The style guide's emphasis on mathematical precision and spiritual beauty perfectly mirrors the story's central theme: that mathematics and art are inseparable, that utility and beauty serve the same purpose, and that geometric patterns are a bridge between the earthly and the transcendent.
