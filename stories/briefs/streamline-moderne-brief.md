# Streamline Moderne Research Brief

## Style: Streamline Moderne

## Period: The 1930s, Depression-era America and Europe

## Story concept:
A passenger's journey aboard the SS Normandie—from boarding through a transformative crossing—mirrors the era's belief that speed, design, and elegance could overcome economic despair. Set against the backdrop of Depression-era uncertainty, the narrative explores how industrial design became a symbol of hope: the sleek locomotive, the gleaming building, the streamlined ocean liner all promising a brighter tomorrow.

## Dramatic arc:
**Setup:** A traveler arrives at a grand streamlined terminal in 1935, stepping into a world transformed by modern design—chrome, curves, porthole windows, and speed. The Great Depression looms outside, but inside gleams optimism through industrial aesthetics.

**Tension:** Boarding the Normandie, the passenger encounters the tension between luxury and economic hardship; wealthy travelers contrast with tales of those left behind; whispers of war gathering across Europe threaten the promise of endless progress.

**Climax:** The ship cuts through Atlantic waters at record-breaking speed; a moment of pure engineering and human achievement where design transcends economic struggle. The passenger witnesses how streamlining isn't just aesthetic—it's a philosophy of improvement and survival.

**Resolution:** Arriving in Europe, the traveler realizes that the Depression won't last forever; the machines, the buildings, the sleek designs prove humanity can engineer its way forward. Design becomes proof that better days are possible.

## Scene outline:

1. **"Terminal Arrival"** — A grand railway station, November 1935. The protagonist enters through streamlined glass doors, observing porters, travelers, and the gleaming chrome fixtures. The setting establishes the world's sleek promise. *Branching point:* Attend a station exhibition or proceed directly to the ship?

2. **"The Briefing"** — A newsreel plays at the terminal, discussing the Depression's impact (unemployment, bank failures, Roosevelt's New Deal). Text crawls across the screen like headlines. Context for why this journey feels momentous.

3. **"Meeting the Captain"** — On the Normandie's deck, the passenger meets the Captain, who speaks of the ship's revolutionary design and record-breaking crossing ahead. He mentions Vladimir Yourkevitch's revolutionary hull. *Branching point:* Tour the engine room (technical knowledge) or the luxury cabins (immersion in elegance)?

4. **"Casting Off"** — The ship pulls from the dock as crowds wave from the pier. Speed lines animate across the screen. A moment of pure momentum and escape. The Depression recedes as the horizon expands.

5. **"First Night Aboard"** — In the grand dining room, the passenger observes the Art Deco interiors, chrome railings, and porthole windows—proof that luxury exists even in hard times. A fellow traveler shares their story of loss and hope.

6. **"The Boiler Room"** — Deep in the ship's heart, the protagonist witnesses the engineering marvel that makes record speed possible. Furnaces glow burgundy and gold. Industrial design becomes romance. *Branching point:* Speak with an engineer (technical details) or return topside?

7. **"Storm at Sea"** — The Atlantic tests the ship's streamlined hull. The design that seemed merely beautiful reveals its function: safety. The passenger realizes engineering serves human survival, not vanity.

8. **"Midnight Conversation"** — A designer passenger shares knowledge of Raymond Loewy, Norman Bel Geddes, and the streamlining movement. They explain how design is a form of hope during depression. *Optional reveal:* Learn about the Coldspot refrigerator's design revolution or the GG-1 locomotive.

9. **"Breaking the Record"** — The ship achieves record-breaking speed on a clear day. Speed lines, chrome reflections, and pure velocity. The protagonist feels humanity's triumph encoded in curves and metal. A moment of cathartic achievement.

10. **"Approaching Europe"** — Dawn breaks over the European coast. The journey nears its end. The passenger reflects on what the streamlined world represents. Whispers of approaching war create bittersweet ambiguity.

11. **"Disembarkation"** — Port arrival. The passenger steps onto the dock, carrying the experience. The streamlined world has changed their perspective. Depression persists, but so does human ingenuity.

12. **"Epilogue: The Future"** — A final note or conversation about what lies ahead. Perhaps mention of the 1939 World's Fair, Futurama, and the vision of 1960. A sense that design shapes destiny.
