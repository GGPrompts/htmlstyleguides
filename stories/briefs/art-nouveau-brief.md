## Story Concept

A sweeping historical drama follows a young poster artist's rise through fin-de-siècle Paris, entangled with a famous actress, absinthe-fueled cafés, and the explosive innovations of the 1900 World's Fair. As Art Nouveau reshapes the city's identity, the protagonist must choose between artistic integrity and the seductive allure of fame, beauty, and "the green hour."

## Key Historical Facts

1. **Art Nouveau Flourished 1890-1910**: The movement emerged as a rebellion against academic eclecticism, employing sinuous organic lines and nature-inspired forms in architecture, posters, jewelry, and decorative arts, reaching its peak at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle.

2. **Alphonse Mucha's Breakthrough: January 6, 1894**: Czech-born poster artist Alphonse Mucha (1860-1939) gained international fame when actress Sarah Bernhardt commissioned him to create a poster for her production of *Gismonda*, launching "le style Mucha" and making him synonymous with Art Nouveau.

3. **Paris Metro Inauguration: July 19, 1900**: Architect Hector Guimard designed the iconic cast iron Art Nouveau entrances to the Paris Métro, with the first line opening from Porte de Vincennes to Porte Maillot during the Exposition Universelle. Between 1900-1912, 141 of Guimard's ornamental stations were installed across Paris.

4. **Exposition Universelle: April 15–November 12, 1900**: The world's fair welcomed 50.8 million visitors across 120 hectares and served as the showcase for Art Nouveau's triumph. The exposition also coincided with the 2nd modern Olympic Games and introduced the Paris public to Rudolf Diesel's revolutionary diesel engine.

5. **Sarah Bernhardt's Dominance 1869-1923**: French-Jewish actress Sarah Bernhardt (1844-1923) reigned as the undisputed star of Belle Époque theater for over 50 years, starring in groundbreaking plays and revolutionizing theatrical roles by performing both female and male characters, including Hamlet.

6. **Lumière Brothers' Cinema Invention: December 28, 1895**: Auguste and Louis Lumière patented their Cinématographe on February 13, 1895, and on December 28, 1895, screened "Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory" at the Grand Café on Boulevard des Capucines in Paris—marking the birth of cinema as a public medium.

7. **Absinthe's Peak Consumption: 1910**: Absinthe consumption in France exploded from 2 million liters annually by 1899 to 36 million liters by 1910. The "green hour" (*l'heure verte*) saw Parisians ending their workdays at cafés, and the drink became inseparable from bohemian artists including Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, and Van Gogh.

8. **Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's First Poster: 1891**: Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901) revolutionized poster art with his 1891 lithograph advertising 'La Goulue' at the Moulin Rouge—3,000 prints were pasted across Paris streets overnight, making him a household name and defining Belle Époque visual culture before his death at 36 in 1901.

9. **Auguste Rodin's 1900 Pavilion**: Celebrated sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) established a personal pavilion at the Place de l'Alma during the 1900 Exposition Universelle, displaying 150 of his sculptures and cementing his reputation as the era's most innovative sculptor, revolutionizing artistic practice to reject idealization.

10. **Paris Population Surge: 64% Growth (1872-1911)**: Paris's population exploded by 64% in the 39 years preceding 1911, driven by urbanization, modernization (electric streetlights installed in 1878), and the construction of the Métro beginning in 1898—transforming it into the "City of Light."

11. **Franco-Prussian War's Shadow (1870-1871)**: France emerged from its devastating loss to Prussia in 1870-71 (138,871 dead, 143,000 wounded, 474,414 captured) to create the Belle Époque—a cultural renaissance born from cultural defiance and artistic innovation as Paris rebuilt itself.

12. **Art Nouveau's Rapid Decline: 1910**: By 1910, the Art Nouveau movement had vanished almost entirely from the European design landscape, replaced by modernist and art deco movements, though its influence on poster art, architecture, and decorative design remained foundational to 20th-century aesthetics.

## Dramatic Arc

**Setup**: A young poster artist arrives in Paris in 1890, witnessing the city's electric transformation. Hector Guimard's Metro entrances are rising from the streets, Alphonse Mucha's images of Sarah Bernhardt plaster every corner, and absinthe flows freely in Montmartre's bohemian cafés.

**Inciting Incident**: The protagonist encounters the famous actress Sarah Bernhardt at a café and is commissioned to create a poster for her next production, parallel to Mucha's own 1894 breakthrough.

**Rising Tension**: Success arrives rapidly, but the protagonist becomes caught between artistic purity and commercial exploitation. Mucha's dominance grows oppressive. The 1900 Exposition Universelle approaches, and everyone seeks the poster that will define the era.

**Climax**: The protagonist's poster is unveiled during the Exposition, competing for attention with Mucha's work, Guimard's Metro stations, Rodin's sculptures, and the Lumière brothers' revolutionary cinema. The moment determines artistic legacy.

**Falling Action**: The protagonist achieves fame but realizes the movement is already dying. By 1910, Art Nouveau is forgotten, replaced by modernism. Friends succumb to absinthe addiction (inspired by Toulouse-Lautrec's tragic death in 1901).

**Resolution**: The protagonist chooses integrity over immortality, abandoning commercial poster art to return to fine art practice, accepting that beauty's seasons are brief—like Paris itself, always reinventing.

## Atmospheric & Special Effects

### Organic Shapes
- Button & card borders: `border-radius: 50% 50% 45% 45% / [varying percentages]` — creates flowing, asymmetric curves
- Form inputs: Organic border-radius with inset shadows for tactile depth
- Badges: Leaf and petal-shaped with `border-radius: 50% 0 50% 0` rotations

### Floral Motifs
- Flourish flowers: 4px rotated diamond shapes forming flower centers
- Corner florals: Multi-layer circular borders in corners of cards
- Footer flowers: Multi-petal arrangement with center bud

### Pattern Backgrounds
- Radial gradient overlays at 40% opacity creating soft, overlapping color washes
- Fixed background with flowing organic ellipses
- Vine borders with repeating linear gradients for vertical botanical accents

### Transitions
- `--transition-slow: 0.5s ease` — hover effects on cards
- `--transition-base: 0.3s ease` — button and form transitions
- `--transition-fast: 0.15s ease` — minor interactions

### Inset & Box Shadows
- Soft shadows with `box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(...)` for card lift
- Inset highlights on buttons and form fields: `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, [0.15-0.25])`
- Warm gold shadows on special elements

### Whiplash Curve
- Signature Art Nouveau element: curved left border in `.whiplash` class
- Gradient from sage → gold → dusty rose → burgundy across vertical 3px line
- Petal accent at top: rotated leaf shape pointing outward

## Design Philosophy Embedded in CSS

1. **Organic Asymmetry**: Every border-radius uses percentage combinations that avoid perfect symmetry
2. **Nature-Inspired Colors**: Palette drawn from sage gardens, dusty antiques, precious metals, floral tones
3. **Integrated Typography**: Three serif fonts work together—decorative, elegant, readable—mirroring Art Nouveau's fusion of beauty and function
4. **Atmospheric Depth**: Layered shadows, wash overlays, and blur filters create immersive environments
5. **Whiplash Dynamism**: Curves suggest movement and life; straight lines are rare and purposeful
6. **Total Design System**: Every element (spacing, color, type, shape) works in harmony—no isolated components

---

## Notes for Story Implementation

- Use `.section` divisions for major narrative beats; each scene can be a separate section
- Layer `.bg-pattern` with narrative tension: increase opacity during climactic moments
- Employ `.quote-block` for historical quotes and character dialogue—the ornament background creates emotional weight
- Use `.badge` strategically to mark historical dates and turning points (`.badge-gold` for 1894, `.badge-burgundy` for 1900, etc.)
- Leverage `.whiplash` styling for moments of internal conflict or artistic breakthrough
- Deploy `.card` components to flesh out historical context without breaking narrative flow
- Let `.vine-divider` mark emotional transitions between scenes
